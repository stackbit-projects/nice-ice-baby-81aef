      frequently asked questions about Nice Ice Baby.

    questions:
      - question: Why would I buy ice when I can make my own?
        answer: >
          Great question, one that only you can answer.


          Why would you clean your own home? Or brew your own beer? Or empty all
          that garbage out of your garage.


          Our ideal world is one where everyone is making all the clear ice they
          desire. Until we reach that nirvana, we're making clear ice for our
          members who've decided to spend their free time on other priority
          tasks, perhaps hammering out the details on their perfect cocktail
          recipe?
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          You can return any unopened, perfectly frozen bags of Nice Ice Baby
          anytime. We do not accept returns for unopened bags of water.
      - question: I don't drink alcohol so I'm in the wrong place right?
        answer: >
          No, no, no my friend. Our ice works equally well with or without the
          devil's elixir.
      - question: Rapid-fire questions
        answer: >-
          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
