    questions:
      - question: Why would I buy ice when I can make my own?
        answer: >
          Great question. One that only you can answer.


          Why would you clean your own home? Or brew your own beer? Or empty all
          that garbage out of your garage.


          Our ideal world has everyone making all the clear ice they desire.
          Until we reach that nirvana, we're making some extra clear ice for our
          memberships who've decided to spend their free time on other priority
          tasks, perhaps hammering out the details on their perfect cocktail
          recipe?
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >-
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

            - All discounted items sales are final.
            - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
            - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
      - question: Rapid-fire questions
        answer: >-
          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
